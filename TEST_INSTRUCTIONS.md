# Test: Knowledge Check Appears at End of Lesson

## Current Implementation Status

The knowledge check is configured to appear when you click "Continue" on the **LAST SECTION** of any lesson.

## How to Test

### Step 1: Open a Lesson
1. Go to http://localhost:5174
2. Click on a lesson card to start it

### Step 2: Navigate Through Sections
1. Look at the sections in the lesson
2. Count how many sections there are (each section has a unique title)
3. Click "Continue" to move through each section
4. **IMPORTANT**: The knowledge check will ONLY appear after you click "Continue" on the VERY LAST section

###  Step 3: Verify Knowledge Check Appears
When you click "Continue" on the last section:
- ✅ Knowledge Check modal should pop up
- ✅ Modal has translucent background
- ✅ Will starts asking questions

## Common Mistake

**Problem**: "I clicked Continue but didn't see the knowledge check"

**Likely Cause**: You weren't on the last section yet.

**Solution**:
- Count the total sections in the lesson
- Make sure you've clicked through ALL of them
- The knowledge check appears AFTER the last section

## How to Know You're on the Last Section

There's currently no visual indicator, but you can:
1. Look at the lesson sections on the left sidebar
2. Count how many "Continue" clicks you've done
3. The knowledge check appears after the final "Continue"

## Alternative: Add Section Counter

Would you like me to add a section counter that shows "Section X of Y" so you know when you're on the last one?

## Debug: Check Current Section

To verify which section you're on:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. In the console, type: `localStorage.debug = true`
3. Reload the page
4. Click through sections
5. Console will show which section number you're on

Let me know if the knowledge check is still not appearing when you're definitely on the last section!
